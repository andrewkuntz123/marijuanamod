# High Harvest 1.20.1 Hi Abby
# Take your farming experience to a whole new level with the _High Harvest_ mod! This mod adds the ability to grow weed seeds, cultivate your very own marijuana plants, and harvest the crops for a new kind of adventure.

## Key Features:

### Grow Weed Seeds:
Start by planting weed seeds! With proper care, these seeds will grow into lush, high-yielding cannabis plants.

### Harvest Marijuana:
Once your plants are ready, harvest them for marijuana buds, which can be used for crafting and further processing.

### Grind Your Harvest:
Use a new item—the grinder—to break down your harvested marijuana into a more refined form, ready for your next step.

### Create Joints and Bongs:
After grinding your marijuana, you can roll it into joints for a laid-back smoke break or craft a bong for a smoother experience. These new items can be used for relaxation and fun effects in your Minecraft world.

## With High Harvest, the possibilities are endless for the stoner farmer looking to add a unique twist to their gameplay. Embark on your green-fingered journey and see how high you can grow your crops!
